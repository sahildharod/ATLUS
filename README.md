This is a project done as a part of the course CS769 : Optimization in Machine Learning.
• Proposal of a hardness definition for curriculum learning to be used along with random
sampling for better self-play fine tuning(SPIN) of LLMs.
• Proposal of a facility coverage maximization-based coreset selection method for optimizing
SPIN fine-tuning of LLMs, built upon the foundation of CORDS IITB.
• Proposal of incorporating adversarial training with the aforementioned techniques to enhance
the robustness of large language models (LLMs) trained under constraints of limited
data and computational resources.
